# Cloud-PurpleTeam-Demo
A Purple-Team Approach to Exploring AWS Security Services &amp; Capabilities

## Abstract

Kenneth G. Hartman will demonstrate common attacks on a load-balanced WordPress EC2 Instance with poor security and showcase how that activity can be detected using cloud-native AWS technologies such as GuardDuty, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, Athena, Config, and CloudWatch. At SANS, we believe that nothing beats hands-on experience, and the goal of this talk is to encourage you to use the cloud as your personal lab for sharpening your offensive and defensive skills.
